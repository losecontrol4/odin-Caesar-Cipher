# odin-Caesar-Cipher

This is the first project through the odin project using ruby. It's the simple message encoding of caesar cipher, which rotates letters x amount of positions in the alphabet based on a number given. Each letter is rotated the same, giving only 25 different possible ciphers needed to solve it. Today, this isn't very secure but it worked for Caesar!

## Update

Most recently, I through in a few tests with rspec to learn how to use rspec
